# Heartbeat Anomaly Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect heartbeat anomalies using a deep learning model, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN). The system processes audio recordings of heartbeats to identify normal and abnormal patterns, which are crucial for early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a custom CNN architecture for accurate anomaly detection in heartbeat sounds.
- **Audio Processing**: Handles preprocessing of raw audio to enhance the detection accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a GUI for easy interaction with the model, suitable for both technical and non-technical users.

## Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riamahajan/Heartbeat-Anomaly-Detection.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd heartbeat-anomaly-detection
```

## Usage
To run the detection model:
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Final_Proposed_CNN_MODEL_for_Heartbeat_Anomaly_Detection.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the notebook cells to load the model and input your audio file for analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes audio files of normal and abnormal heartbeats, processed to generate suitable inputs for the CNN model.

## Output
The system outputs whether the analyzed heartbeat sound is normal or abnormal, providing a preliminary diagnostic tool that can aid further medical evaluation.
